# AppModule

An Xcode File Template to streamline App Module production

## Usage
Copy the content of this folder in:
`~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File Template/YourCustomTemplateFolder`

## Note
AS the `View` and `Controller` are the same in each variation of the template, the `base` folder contains original files, and the variation folder contain a hard link to the base file.
